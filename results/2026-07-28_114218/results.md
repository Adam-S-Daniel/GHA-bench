# Benchmark Results: Language Comparison

**Last updated:** 2026-07-28 07:48:21 AM ET — 1/4 runs completed, 3 remaining; total cost $0.51; total agent time 5.9 min.
**Claude Code versions used:** v2.1.220 (1 run). Each link goes to a per-version snapshot of the system prompt, default-tool descriptions, and the chronological Anthropic changelog up to that version. Regenerate with `python3 version_docs.py`.

## Scoring

Judges: panel of LLM-as-judge models — `haiku-4-5` (via Claude CLI) and `Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)` (via the Antigravity `agy` CLI). Each run's quality score is the mean of both judges, cached per-run so numbers are deterministic across regenerations. Known bias caveats live in the [Judge Consistency Summary](#judge-consistency-summary).

**Tests Quality** = Overall score (1-5) for the generated **test code**.

Dimensions:
- **coverage** — requirements tested
- **rigor** — edge cases + error paths
- **design** — fixture quality + independence
- **overall** — holistic

**Workflow Craft** = Overall score (1-5) for the produced **deliverable** (workflow YAML + scripts, excluding tests).

Dimensions:
- **best_practices** — language-appropriate conventions
- **conciseness** — penalizes dead code AND repetition that should be factored
- **readability** — clarity for a reader encountering it cold
- **maintainability** — modularity, error-handling, testability
- **overall** — holistic

**Duration / Cost** = ratio of each combo's average to the best combo's average on the same axis (lower is better).

Properties:
- **Scale:** ratios, not raw seconds or dollars
- **Band calibration:** auto-calibrated to the data's best-to-worst spread via log-equal division (`boundary_i = max_ratio^(i/12)`), so the best observed ratio lands at A+ and the worst at D-
- **F band:** reserved for ratios beyond the observed worst

### Duration columns

Every Duration figure in this report derives from `timing.grand_total_duration_ms` in `metrics.json` — wall-clock seconds from CLI invocation to the final assistant turn (agent thinking + tool execution).

- **Duration** (single run): that one run's wall clock. Appears in the [Failed / Timed-Out Runs](#failed--timed-out-runs) and per-run detail tables.
- **Geo Duration / Geo Cost / Geo Turns** (in the [Comparison by Language/Model/Effort](#comparison-by-languagemodeleffort) table; Geo Duration and Geo Cost also drive the [Tiers](#tiers-by-languagemodeleffort) Duration/Cost columns): **geometric** means (issue #33) — outlier-damped relative to a plain average, so one abnormally slow/expensive/chatty run doesn't dominate a combo's aggregate.
- The **Geo Duration pool additionally includes timed-out runs**, counted at their recorded wall clock. A timeout is right-censored — its true duration might have been longer, but is known to be AT LEAST the recorded value — so excluding it outright would effectively reward timing out with a better average.
- **Total Cost** now includes timed-out cells: the CLI-recorded cost when the stream captured a final result record, otherwise a **floor estimate recovered from the partial `cli-output.json` event stream** (see `recover_cost.py`) — input / cache-read / cache-write tokens are exact per-message usage; output tokens are estimated from visible content plus thinking-token telemetry (a lower bound: most thinking output never appears in a killed stream) and priced via `models.py`. Rows containing a timeout without CLI-recorded cost are `≥`-prefixed.
- **Geo Cost / Geo Turns still exclude every failed run, including timeouts**: a killed CLI records `cost=0`/`turns=0`, which is missing data, not a real zero, and recovered floors are estimates — pooling a known-low bound into a geometric mean would bias the ratio statistics the tiers are built from. The exact-vs-floor distinction only affects the additive Total Cost column.
- **Max Duration** is the slowest run in the Geo Duration pool for that combo, `≥`-prefixed when that run was a timeout (true duration unknown, but at least the shown value).
- **Avg Errors** remains an arithmetic mean.
- **Geo Duration Net of Traps** (in the Comparison table only): the geometric mean of (per-run `Duration` − that run's `Time Lost`), where `Time Lost` is the trap detector's estimate of seconds spent on detected anti-patterns (see [Trap Descriptions](#trap-descriptions) and the trap-table [Column Definitions](#column-definitions) for the trap list and how Time Lost is computed). Pooled over the SAME runs as Geo Duration — timed-out cells are included, with their detected traps (if any) deducted too. Reads as a counterfactual: roughly how fast each combo would have been without the detected traps.
- The **Tier table's Duration/Cost columns** show the tier letter (A+..F) for the combo's gross **Geo Duration**/**Geo Cost** ratio. Net of Traps does not feed the tier band.
